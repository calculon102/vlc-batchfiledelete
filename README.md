# BatchFileDelete

Extension for the [VLC] media player extension. Enables batch-processing a playlist while deciding to skip or physically delete the current playing item. In any case, the next item will be played after decision is made.

## Motivation

I was surprised that after so many years of VLC and VLC-extension there was no real option or extension to reliably delete files directly from VLC (or any other media player). Yes, there are some platform-dependent alternatives, but these are not made for batch-processing large playlists with previewing via playing.

## Current state

This extension just _works for me_ and is in beta-state. It probably needs additional testing for different OS and playlist situations. Please do not hesistate to write a comment or mail describing a concrete error message or situation.
